(** This module is used to defined a relation order (let's write it
   >>) between non-evaluated formulas.

   f1 >> f2 means f1 must be evaluated in order to evaluate f2.

   f1 >> f2 >> f1 is a typical cycle.

   f1 >> f2 âˆ§ f1 >> f3 means evaluating f1 is required to evaluate f2
   and f3.

    >> is only transitive.

    Once the order is defined (either from one specific position using
   [build_formulas_order_from] or from a list of formulas using
   [build_formulas_order_from_all], one can :

    - access the computable formulas, i.e. the formulas with no
   relation *going to it* on the previously defined order (f1 is
   computable if there exists no f2 such as f2 >> f1).

    - once a formula as been evaluated, remove it from the order to
   free and get the newly computable formulas.

    - and keep going recursively until every computable formulas have
   been evaluated. At this point, the only formulas still in the order
   are necessary involved in a local cycle and so non-computable. They
   then can be extracted to set their value to [Undefined].
