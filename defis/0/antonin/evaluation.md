Correction
	anagram(String s) should not return s into the results
Complexite
	Nothing to say
Performance
	Golang is lightweight and speedy, the algorithms are great
Robustesse
	Program handle when special characters are used but also empty lines and huge strings. Maybe test under another text format ?
Lisibilite
	Straight forward even if you don’t know Golang.
Portabilite
	Golang is easily portable and there is no system-specific call into the program.
Modularite
	Need to go further with modularity. Some treatments should be separated from the main
Generalite
	For the palindrom’s case, maybe the code will need some refactoring, the main() being too specific for the problem ?
Extensibilite
	N/A
Evolutivite
	N/A
